I am a first-year graduate student at the Princeton Physics Department, and previously went to Caltech where I did my B.S. in Physics. I'm interested in designing and developing hardware and software techniques to improve the chances of discovering new physics at experiments such as the Compact Muon Solenoid at CERN, and PTOLEMY (Princeton Tritium Observatory for Light, Early-Universe, Massive-Neutrino Yield). Outside of research, I enjoy organizing events and being engaged with the Princeton Women in Physics group.

Research
======
I will be traveling to CERN the summer of 2019 to continue my research on developing machine learning techniques for high-speed, low-cost FPGAs, that will be capable of rapidly and accurately identifying particles at the CMS Experiment's Level 1 Trigger in the High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. This work will be conducted with the mentorship of [Prof. Isobel Ojalvo](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/isobel-ojalvo). I am also planning future work on the [PTOLEMY experiment](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2016/03/14/hunt-big-bang-neutrinos-may-provide-fresh-insight-origin-universe) for cosmic relic neutrino detection, with the mentorship of [Prof. Chris Tully](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/christopher-tully).

Starting in Fall 2019, I will also be supported by the National Science Foundation's [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org).

Princeton WiP group
======
With the [Princeton Women in Physics group](https://wip.princeton.edu), which encompasses women* graduate students, postdocs, and faculty, I have helped spearhead initiatives such as a new "What is Grad School?" bi-annual workshop series with the Undergraduate Women in Physics group, and a "Craft Your Career" bi-annual workshop series for early and mid-career graduate women to learn from current postdocs and older graduate students. Through my involvement with WiP, I aim to create opportunities for informal and formal mentorship, and to help foster an inclusive atmosphere in our department.

Other recent activities in the department
====== 
I was a member of the Physics Graduate Open House Committee in Spring 2019, and assisted in organizing the Open House for prospective graduate students. I am also a representative for my cohort in the Physics Graduate Committee, which meets as a group with the Dean of Graduate Studies annually to discuss concerns and suggestions in the graduate body. 

During the 2018-19 academic year I was a mentor to Princeton undergraduates in programs organized by the Undergraduate Women in Physics and Princeton Society for Physics Students.
